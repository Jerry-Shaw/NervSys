# How to install

Installation is very simple, just follow the steps below:

* Clone NervSys to your project form github, both submodule or project root, or, even anywhere else outside the project are supported;
* Copy "api.php.example" to your web root and rename the extension to ".php";
* Modify the content of the entry file mentioned above if needed;
* Copy "app.ini.example" to your app directory if needed and rename the extension to ".ini";
* Modify the content of the configuration file mentioned above if needed;
* All done. Now, write your own codes following the rest of README.  
  
Notice: From version 7.4.5 and on, multiple projects now can share just one copy of NS on disk. Only to make sure that, all the entries need to required "sys.php" in the right path.
