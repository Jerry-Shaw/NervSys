 * This script is an universal API script.
 * Access-Key check is recommended for higher security.
 * Enable GET Method can be controlled by "\data_pool::$enable_get".
 * But it is strongly not recommended to enable GET Method.
 * Just simply leave it as it is for system security.
 * Or, only enable it when debug is needed.
